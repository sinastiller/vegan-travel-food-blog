This website uses a palette of green and light pink tones and some variants of the same color scheme belonging to their color family. It was created by using [Adobe Express Free Logo Maker](#https://www.adobe.com/express/create/logo).

### [Typography](#typography)
I have imported the following Google Fonts:
* Playfair Display for headings on website.
* Montserrat for the body text on the website.

Imagery is used regarding the travel and food content on the website. They are taken of various websites, which are credited down below in the [Credits](#credits) section.
